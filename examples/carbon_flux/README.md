# CO_2 Flux:

This is a regression task where HLS images and corresponding MERRA-2 data for a region are passed in parallel
to the model and combine the result to predict CO_2 flux value for that region. 

HLS images are passed through prithvi_pretrained model, but not the MERRA-2 data.

However both prithvi output and MERRA-2 data are projected in same embedding space to combine.
